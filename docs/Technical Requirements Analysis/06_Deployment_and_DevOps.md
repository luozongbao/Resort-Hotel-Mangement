# 6. Deployment and DevOps

This document outlines the strategy for deployment, continuous integration, and infrastructure management.

## 6.1. Containerization
-   **Docker**: The entire application stack (Nginx, PHP-FPM, MariaDB, Redis) will be containerized using Docker. This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
-   **Docker Compose**: For local development and simpler deployments, `docker-compose.yml` will be used to define and orchestrate the multi-service application.

## 6.2. Environments
-   **Development**: Local environment managed via Docker Compose.
-   **Staging/Testing**: A production-like environment for testing new features and bug fixes before they are deployed to production.
-   **Production**: The live environment serving customers.

## 6.3. Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
-   **Version Control**: **Git** will be the version control system, with a central repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab).
-   **CI Pipeline**: A CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) will be triggered on every push or pull request. The pipeline will:
    -   Install dependencies.
    -   Run automated tests (unit, feature, integration).
    -   Perform static analysis (linting).
-   **CD Pipeline**: Upon a successful merge to the main branch, a CD pipeline will automatically:
    -   Build Docker images.
    -   Push images to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
    -   Deploy the new version to the staging environment.
    -   A manual trigger will be required for deployment to the production environment.

## 6.4. Infrastructure & Hosting
-   **Cloud Provider**: The application will be hosted on a major cloud provider like **DigitalOcean**, **AWS**, or **Google Cloud**.
-   **Scalability**: The infrastructure will be designed for horizontal scaling. A load balancer will distribute traffic across multiple application server instances.
-   **Managed Services**: Where possible, managed services will be used for the database (e.g., AWS RDS, DigitalOcean Managed Databases) and Redis to simplify maintenance and backups.

## 6.5. Backups & Monitoring
-   **Automated Backups**: Regular, automated backups of the database and any persistent file storage (like guest ID photos) are critical. Backup restoration procedures should be tested periodically.
-   **Monitoring & Logging**: A monitoring solution (e.g., Prometheus with Grafana, or a service like Datadog) will be implemented to track application performance, server health, and errors in real-time. Centralized logging will be used to aggregate logs from all services.
