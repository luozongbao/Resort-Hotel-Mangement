# 5. Security and Authentication

This document outlines the security measures and authentication mechanisms for the Resort Hotel Management System.

## 5.1. Authentication
-   **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: The primary method for securing the API. Tokens will be generated upon successful login and will have a limited expiration time to reduce the risk of token hijacking.
-   **Secure Credentials Storage**: User passwords will be securely hashed using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm like **Bcrypt**.
-   **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: For enhanced security, especially for administrative roles, MFA (e.g., via email or authenticator app) should be an available option.

## 5.2. Authorization
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: The system will implement a granular RBAC model.
    -   **Permissions**: Specific actions (e.g., `create-booking`, `edit-room`, `view-financial-reports`) will be defined as permissions.
    -   **Roles**: Roles (e.g., 'Resort Admin', 'Front Desk', 'Housekeeper') will be created as collections of permissions.
    -   **User Assignment**: Each user will be assigned one or more roles, which will determine their access rights.
-   **Tenant-Based Authorization**: API requests will be scoped to the user's tenant. A user from Tenant A will be strictly prevented from accessing any data belonging to Tenant B, enforced at the database query level.

## 5.3. Data Security
-   **Data in Transit**: All communication between clients and the server will be encrypted using **SSL/TLS (HTTPS)**.
-   **Data at Rest**: Sensitive data stored in the database (e.g., guest personal information) should be encrypted where appropriate.
-   **ID Card Photos**: Photos of guest IDs must be stored securely with restricted access, and policies for their retention and deletion should be established.

## 5.4. API Security
-   **API Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, the API will implement rate limiting on a per-user or per-IP basis.
-   **Input Validation**: All incoming data from API requests will be rigorously validated to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
-   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: A strict CORS policy will be configured to ensure that the API can only be accessed from authorized frontend domains.

## 5.5. Auditing
-   **Activity Logging**: The system will maintain an audit trail of significant actions, such as user logins, booking modifications, and changes to user permissions. This is crucial for security analysis and troubleshooting.
