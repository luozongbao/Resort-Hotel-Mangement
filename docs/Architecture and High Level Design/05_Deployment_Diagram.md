# Deployment Diagram

This document illustrates the high-level deployment strategy for the Resort Hotel Management System, showing how the software components are mapped to the underlying infrastructure. This model assumes a containerized deployment on a cloud provider.

## Deployment Strategy Description

1.  **Entry Point**: All incoming traffic from clients (web browsers or mobile apps) first hits a **Load Balancer**. The load balancer is responsible for terminating SSL (HTTPS) and distributing requests evenly across the available application servers.

2.  **Application Servers**: The core application runs on one or more identical application servers. This design allows for **horizontal scalability**â€”if traffic increases, more servers can be added to the pool to handle the load.

3.  **Containerization**: Each application server runs a set of **Docker containers**.
    -   **Nginx Container**: Acts as a reverse proxy, serving static files and forwarding dynamic requests to the application container.
    -   **App Container (PHP-FPM)**: Contains the Laravel application code and runs the PHP-FPM process to execute the application logic.

4.  **Managed Services**: To reduce operational overhead and improve reliability, the stateful parts of the system are offloaded to managed services provided by the cloud host.
    -   **Managed Database**: A highly available and automatically backed-up database service (e.g., Amazon RDS, DigitalOcean Managed Database). The application containers connect to this central database.
    -   **Managed Cache**: A managed Redis instance for caching, sessions, and queues.
    -   **Object Storage**: A service like Amazon S3 for storing user-uploaded files (e.g., ID photos), separate from the application servers.

This architecture separates the stateless application logic (which can be easily scaled) from the stateful data stores, which is a standard and robust pattern for building scalable web applications.
